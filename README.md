This is a react project that should work with heroku

to start, you need to npm install in the root folder, client folder, and server folder

to run locally, "npm run dev" in the root folder

if you want to use mongoDB atlas, you must set that up and set the correct URI in the server/db folder

then you can use the server with "node index.js" in the root folder
